This is a C++ implementation of the method described in:

"Minimum Barrier Salient Object Detection at 80 FPS" Jianming Zhang et al.,ICCV,2015

Contact:dzhchxk@126.com

Prerequisite: OpenCV 2.4+

This code shoule be executed in Linux!
Usage:

	1.Go to the folder "src"
	2.modify the opencv include and lib paths in makefile.
	3.compile the code with the command "make"
	4.run for example: "./main ../dog.jpg"
	  There are two parameters in main function, and the second is the image path.
	  As for the image path, both absolute and relative are ok.

This C++ implementation is possessed by MCG ICT only.

The C++ implementation is slower than the official C++ executable.
Maybe the official version has been optimized for speed up.
